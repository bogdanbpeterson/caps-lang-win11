# CapsLang

I was a long time user of https://github.com/mohsen3/CapsLang but eventually got tired of accidental language switches (it uses `alt + shift` combination).
So, here's a revised version for win 8+ that uses `win + space` combination since it's almost unused combination of them all (in other combination ofc xD).

I suggest disabling the `alt + shift` combination but it's up to you:
